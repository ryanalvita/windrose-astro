    <p>
        I developed and maintained this ready-to-use windrose generator web
        application by myself. I aim to make someone's life (might be me) a bit
        easier, either you're a student, a corporate-slave, an entrepreneur, or
        just a simply data enthusiast. 📊
    </p>

    <p>
        Therefore, if my projects saved you some headaches or freed up your day,
        how about fueling future updates with a coffee? Your support keeps the
        code flowing, and the caffeine, too! ☕
